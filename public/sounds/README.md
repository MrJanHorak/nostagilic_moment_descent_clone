# Game Sound Files

This directory contains synthesized sound effects for the game. These are fallback sounds generated using the Web Audio API, but you can replace them with actual audio files with these names for better quality:

- `engine.mp3` - Continuous engine hum
- `thruster.mp3` - Sound when moving
- `laser_shoot.mp3` - Player weapon fire
- `enemy_shoot.mp3` - Enemy weapon fire
- `hit.mp3` - When projectile hits something
- `explosion.mp3` - Enemy destruction
- `player_damage.mp3` - When player takes damage
- `powerup.mp3` - Generic powerup collection
- `heal.mp3` - Health powerup collection
- `weapon_boost.mp3` - Weapon upgrade powerup collection
- `speed_boost.mp3` - Speed boost powerup collection
- `menu_select.mp3` - UI click sound
- `game_over.mp3` - Game over sound
- `background_music.mp3` - Background music track

The game will use the built-in synthesized sounds if these files are not available.
